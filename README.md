#  Agents and Multi-agent Systems

## About:
The Group Project consisted in implementing a multi-agent system with smart agents, using SPADE. The goal of this project is to enable the agents in this system to communicate with each other and interpret the received information in order to take coordinated intelligent actions. Specifically, our objective is to simulate the landing and takeoff of multiple airplanes without conflicts between them and without any plane being left waiting to land for extended periods of time.
